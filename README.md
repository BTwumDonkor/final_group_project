# Final Group Project
## First Segment Requirements

### Presentation 
1. Selected topic
2. Reason behind the selection 
3. Description of the source of data
4. Questions that we wish to have answered with the data

Note: The content does not yet need to be in the form of a presentation; text in the README.md works as well. 

### GitHub 
1. Main Branch includes a README.md
2. README.md must include description of the communication protocols
3. Individual Branches 
      - At least one branch for each team member 
      - Each team member has at least four commits from the duration of the first segment
      - NOTE: The descriptions and explanations required in all other project deliverables should also be in your README.md as part of your outline, unless otherwise noted.

### Machine Learning Model 
1. A provisional machine learning model exists that stands in for the final machine learning model and accomplishes the following:
      - Takes in data in from the provisional database 
      - Outputs label(s) for input data

If statistical analysis is not included as part of the current analysis, the team should add a description of how it would be included in the next phases of the project.

### Database
1. A provisional database exists that stands in for the final database and accomplishes the following:
      - Sample data that mimics the expected final database structure or schema 
      - Draft machine learning module is connected to the provisional database
