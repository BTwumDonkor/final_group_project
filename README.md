# Final Group Project - First Segment

Welcome to the final group project of the Data Analytics Bootcamp. This final project has been designed to showcase the skills learned in the bootcamp.
This is the first segment of four. 

Group members include (in alphabetical order):
- Anand Bajaj
- Katrin Freitag
- Matthew Lao
- Boakye Twum

As a group, we have decided to analyze the effects of restaurant customers in the United States. The following portion provides more detail regarding each section that is requried for the first segment of this project.

## First Segment Requirements

### Presentation 
For this project, we have decided to analyze customers preference for American-traditional vs. Non-American-traditional restaurants in the United States. To help analyze customer preferences, we are using [Yelp Dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset/). This dataset has been selected as it provides a large amount of information regarding American and Canadian businesses. It provides information regarding users, their star ratings, rating counts, reviews, and tips. The dataset has been cleaned, organized and exported into csv files for future analysis. The data has been reduced to focus on 1000 businesses, users, reviews, and tips:
- [Business Top 1000](Sample Data/BusinessTop1000.csv]
- [Reviews Top 1000](Sample Data/ReviewTop1000.csv]
- [Users Top 1000](Sample Data/UserTop1000.csv]
- [Tip Top 1000](Sample Data/TipTop1000.csv]

Usind this data, we are trying to gather more information regarding the following business problem: 

####### Business Problem: Non-American-Traditional restaurants receive a higher star rating in the Western states of the United States. 

### GitHub 
1. Main Branch includes a README.md
2. README.md must include description of the communication protocols
3. Individual Branches 
      - At least one branch for each team member 
      - Each team member has at least four commits from the duration of the first segment
      - NOTE: The descriptions and explanations required in all other project deliverables should also be in your README.md as part of your outline, unless otherwise noted.

### Machine Learning Model 
1. A provisional machine learning model exists that stands in for the final machine learning model and accomplishes the following:
      - Takes in data in from the provisional database 
      - Outputs label(s) for input data

If statistical analysis is not included as part of the current analysis, the team should add a description of how it would be included in the next phases of the project.

### Database
1. A provisional database exists that stands in for the final database and accomplishes the following:
      - Sample data that mimics the expected final database structure or schema 
      - Draft machine learning module is connected to the provisional database
